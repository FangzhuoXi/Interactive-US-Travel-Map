After a family visit to the Peregrine Fund's World Center for Birds of Prey and an outdoor performance at the Idaho Shakespeare Festival, the next stop after Boise is likely to be Payette Lake in McCall or Sun Valley and Ketchum. About 100 miles north of Boise, past Cascade Lake, McCall takes you to the shores of Payette Lake. Go golfing, fishing, hiking, biking, waterskiing, sailing, boating, or whitewater river rafting. Ski or snowshoe Brundage Mountain or Tamarack Resorts, as well as Ponderosa State Park in winter. Ice skate year-round at Manchester Ice & Event Centre. About 450 miles north of Boise, there are resort lakes near skiing and golf at Coeur d'Alene, Hayden Lake, and Sandpoint. Golf, tennis, mountain biking, hiking, fishing, rafting, and hunting are popular in Sun Valley and Ketchum. Sockeye salmon may no longer do much spawning in Redfish Lake, but the boating and mountain scenery in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area make the short trip north to Stanley worthwhile. When the snows come the whole family will head for the slopes of Soldier Mountain, Bald Mountain, Dollar Mountain, or the Sun Valley Resort. A tiny forested town of about 250 people, Island Park has a large reservoir with fishing and boating, as well as Henry's Fork of the Snake River for fly fishing.

From the soaring peaks of the Grand Tetons to Jackson Hole valley and Yellowstone National Park, the mountain landscape and natural wonders of Wyoming are breathtaking. All-season outdoor activities prove a natural draw for families, couples and group getaways. Sports lovers golf through spring and summer at attractive rates or tackle river and lake fishing, hunting and hiking. Families take to Alpine skiing and snowmobiling in Jackson Hole, Snow King, Grand Targhee and Pine Creek. Every visitor is awed by the deep canyons and steaming geysers of The Yellowstone National Park. Each magnificent sight rivals the next. The Grand Tetons rise over a mile above Jackson Hole valley, where a ride on the Aerial Tram from Teton Village offers unforgettable views. Across the entire state, wildlife stakes its rightful claim, from bison and bighorn sheep herds to black bear and mountain elk. For a step back in frontier history, take the family to Go Native America to experience Native American culture, history and arts of the Plains Tribes. Enjoy tours with indigenous guides, horseback riding and roping lessons. With every experience, your family will gain a sense of the pioneer spirit that pushed America westward.",
